# buscalibre-scrapping
This repository allows the scrapping of the **[buscalibre.pe](https://www.buscalibre.pe/)** website using BeatifulSoup. The user inputs the topic of the books they are searching for. The code scraps prices (before and after a discount) and returns the cheapest book in that topic as well as the book with the highest discount.
